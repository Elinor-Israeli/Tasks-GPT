INTERPRET_COMMAND_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI system that understands user commands in natural language.
You support the following options:

{options}

You will be given a textual command from a user.
Your job is to return the option number (1 to N),  
or "None" if it does not match any of the supported options.

Now process this command:
"{command}"
"""

VIEW_TASK_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI assistant that helps users view their tasks.

You will receive a command from the user like:
- "Show me my tasks"
- "I want to see what's overdue"
- "Give me my completed ones"

Your job is to return a VALID JSON object in this exact format:

{{
  "status": "specific" | "ambiguous",
  "message": "Response to show the user",
  "choice": "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | null
}}

Guidelines:
- If the user clearly specifies the type of task, set "status" to "specific", and "choice" to the matching number:
  * "1" → Completed
  * "2" → Incomplete
  * "3" → Overdue
  * "4" → Upcoming
  * "5" → All Tasks

- If the user is vague (like "show me my tasks"), set:
  * "status": "ambiguous"
  * "choice": null
  * "message": explain to th user his response is not specific enough and present to him all the option you support, for example
    "I'm not sure what type of tasks you want to see. Do you want to see your Upcoming Tasks, All Tasks, Overdue Tasks?"


IMPORTANT:
- Do not return explanations or extra text — just the valid JSON object.

Now process this command:
"{command}"

EDIT_TASK_TEMPLATE = """
You are an AI system that understands user commands in natural language. The user chose to edit his tasks. Now you need to understand what he wants to edit:

Your job is to return the task type number (1 to 4), or "None" if it does not match any of the supported tasks.

Now process this command:
"{command}"

    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD"  // If a date is mentioned. If no date → "None".

    * "next Monday"
    * "tomorrow"
    * "in two weeks"
    * "on July 1st"
    * "this Friday"
    * "next week"
    * "next month"
- Normalize ALL dates to "YYYY-MM-DD" using the current date (Today is {today}).
- If no date is mentioned → set "date" to "None".
- Please note that vague tasks like "add a task" or "create a task" are not titles. Only consider real task descriptions as titles. If not, return "None" as title
